    "From a clinical trial, we have 12 patients with HIV infection. After treatment, the disease progressed in 6 patients (1) and in 6 patients the infection did not progress (0). Four measurements are taken in the 12 patients (Age, sugar levels, T cell levels, and Cholesterol). Which measurement can be used as a marker to describe the progression of the disease? Which will be the criteria to predict the progression? The data can be found in `problem2.csv (x_age, x_sugar, x_Tcell, x_cholesterol, outcome)`. Arrange the data and briefly explain your results. The variable `y` (target) is a vector of 0 and 1 to represent the progression."
